# Configure this repository to use Git's type detection algorithm to guess
# whether a file is text or binary. Text files will have line endings converted
# as if you had set
#   eol=native
# That is, on Windows text files will have CRLF line endings in your working
# directory while on Linux and macOS your text files will have LF line endings
# in your working directory. In either case, they will have LF line endings in
# the Git repository itself.

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto eol=lf
